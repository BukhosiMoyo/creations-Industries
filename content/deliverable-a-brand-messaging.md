## 5. Voice Rules (10 Hard Rules)

1. **No hype.** Do not use words like "revolutionary", "game-changing", or "disrupting". We are an accounting firm, not a start-up pitch deck.
2. **No guarantees.** Never claim guaranteed SARS refunds, guaranteed CIPC approvals, or guaranteed outcomes. Use language like "we prepare", "we support", "we structure".
3. **Clarity-first language.** If a sentence requires a glossary to understand, rewrite it. Short sentences. Active voice. Plain English.
4. **Calm, confident tone.** The voice should feel like a composed professional explaining something important to you across a desk. Not selling. Informing.
5. **ZA terms explained simply.** When using acronyms like PAYE, UIF, SDL, COIDA, VAT, always ensure context makes the meaning clear. On first use per page, expand the acronym or follow with a brief explanation.
6. **No filler.** Every sentence must carry information or intent. Remove "leveraging synergies", "holistic solutions", and similar empty phrases.
7. **No invented statistics.** Do not fabricate client numbers, success rates, or percentages. If data is not verified, do not include it.
8. **Professional, not stiff.** The tone is modern and approachable but never casual. No slang, no exclamation marks in body copy, no emojis.
9. **Action-oriented CTAs.** Calls to action must be specific: "Request a Quote", "Book a Consultation", "View Our Services"—not "Learn More" or "Click Here".
10. **Respectful of complexity.** Acknowledge that tax, compliance, and accounting are complex. Do not trivialise them. Position our role as making the complex manageable, not making it disappear.
