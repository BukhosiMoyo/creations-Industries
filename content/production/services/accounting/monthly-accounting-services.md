## 2. WHAT ARE MONTHLY ACCOUNTING SERVICES?
Monthly accounting services provide ongoing, proactive financial management rather than waiting for year-end to "fix" the books. In this model, your accounting, bookkeeping, and tax requirements are handled simultaneously throughout the month, ensuring that your financial data is always current and decision-ready.

For modern South African businesses, monthly accounting is the most efficient way to maintain a "green" status with SARS and CIPC, as it ensures that every deadline is met proactively and every transaction is recorded correctly from day one.

## 3. WHY MONTHLY SUPPORT IS SUPERIOR (CONTEXT)
The traditional model of visiting an accountant once a year is increasingly risky in the digital era. Typically, Businesses relying on annual reviews face:

- **Lagged Decision-Making:** Realizing you overspent or lost money 6 months after the fact.
- **Cash Flow Volatility:** Sudden, large accounting and tax bills that weren't budgeted for.
- **Inaccurate Records:** Trying to remember what a specific expense was from 11 months ago.
- **Missed SARS Deadlines:** Only discovering a compliance issue when it's already too late to avoid interest and penalties.

On average, businesses move to a monthly accounting model save between 15% and 25% in total annual administrative costs due to increased efficiency and the removal of "cleanup" fees.
