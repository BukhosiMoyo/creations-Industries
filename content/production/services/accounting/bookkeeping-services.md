## 2. WHAT ARE BOOKKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING SERVICES?
Bookkeeping is the systematic recording of every financial transaction your business makes. It is the "engine room" of your financial management. When combined with professional accounting oversight, these services transform a pile of receipts and bank statements into a structured, audit-ready financial record.

Our bookkeeping service ensures that your income and expenses are correctly categorized, bank accounts are reconciled, and your VAT records are consistently maintained, providing the raw data needed for high-level financial decisions.

## 3. WHY BOOKKEEPING MATTERS (WITH CONTEXT)
In the South African business environment, poor bookkeeping is often the root cause of SARS penalties and failed tender applications. Many businesses rely on "shoebox" accounting, which typically leads to:

- **Missing VAT Input Claims:** Losing money by not tracking deductible expenses correctly.
- **SARS Audit Risk:** Inability to provide supporting documents for historical transactions.
- **Unclear Debtors:** Not knowing exactly who owes the business money at any given time.
- **Year-End Panic:** Spending weeks trying to reconstruct a year's worth of data in February.

Typically, SMEs that implement structured monthly bookkeeping save up to 40% in year-end accounting costs because their records are already clean and reconciled.

## 10. SOUTH AFRICAN COMPLIANCE CONTEXT
Our bookkeeping follows the **Generally Recognized Accounting Practice (GRAP)** guidelines where applicable and ensures that all records are kept for the **5-year period** required by SARS. We also ensure that VAT is handled according to the **VAT Act**, distinguishing correctly between standard-rated, zero-rated, and exempt supplies.

## 11. HELPFUL INSIGHTS / STATS BOX
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Cost of "Doing it Later":**
> Reconstructing a year's worth of bookkeeping in a rush typically costs 2x more than maintaining it monthly. More importantly, you lose the ability to spot financial red flags until it might be too late to act.

## 12. FAQs
**Do I have to use Xero or Sage?**
While we strongly recommend cloud software for its efficiency and SARS-readiness, we can work with your existing system or help you transition from spreadsheets.

**Can you help me get my VAT registered?**
Yes. Accurate bookkeeping is the first step. Once your records show you've met the R50,000 (voluntary) or R1 million (compulsory) threshold, we can handle the application for you.

**Do I still need an accountant if I have a bookkeeper?**
Yes. A bookkeeper records the daily data; an accountant reviews that data, makes high-level adjustments (like depreciation), and prepares your formal Annual Financial Statements. We offer both in an integrated package.

**How do I send you my slips?**
We use digital tools that allow you to simply "snap and send" a photo of your slip from your phone. No more physical shoeboxes of paper.

**What if I have missing receipts?**
We will flag missing items in your monthly report. While we can process the bank entry, SARS requires a valid invoice/slip to claim VAT or tax deductions.
