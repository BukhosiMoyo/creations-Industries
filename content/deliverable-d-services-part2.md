### Service Intro (155 words)
Every company and close corporation registered in South Africa is required to maintain its status with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). This includes filing annual returns on time, updating director and member details, maintaining registered office information, and ensuring your entity's status remains in good standing. Falling behind on CIPC obligations can lead to penalties, a non-compliant entity status, or even deregistration — any of which can block tenders, banking applications, and contracts. We handle the full scope of CIPC compliance: from new company registrations and conversions to annual return filings and director amendments. Whether you have one entity or several, we ensure your CIPC records are current, accurate, and compliant. If your company has already been deregistered or flagged as non-compliant, we can assist with reinstatement and resolution.

### Deliverables
- New company and close corporation registrations
- Annual return filing (AR)
- Director and member amendments (CoR39)
- Registered office address changes
- Company name reservations and changes
- Entity status checks and compliance reports
- Deregistration and reinstatement support

### Process Steps
1. **Status check** — We retrieve your entity's CIPC status and identify any overdue filings or issues.
2. **Document preparation** — We gather the required resolutions, IDs, and supporting documents.
3. **Filing and submission** — All forms are submitted to CIPC and tracked to completion.
4. **Confirmation** — You receive filing confirmations and updated company documents.
5. **Ongoing monitoring** — We track annual return deadlines and notify you in advance.

### FAQs

**Q1: What happens if I miss my CIPC annual return?**
A: CIPC may impose penalties and eventually deregister your company for non-compliance. This can affect your ability to trade, open bank accounts, or bid on tenders.

**Q2: Can you register a new company for me?**
A: Yes. We handle the full registration process, including name reservation, submission of incorporation documents, and issuing of the registration certificate.

**Q3: How do I change a director on my company?**
A: Director changes require a CoR39 filing with CIPC. We prepare the necessary resolutions and submit the change on your behalf.

**Q4: What is the difference between a company and a close corporation?**
A: A company (Pty Ltd) is governed by the Companies Act, 2008. A close corporation (CC) is an older entity form that can no longer be newly registered but can still operate and must comply with CIPC requirements.

**Q5: Can you reinstate a deregistered company?**
A: In most cases, yes. We assess the reason for deregistration, prepare the application, and submit to CIPC. Results depend on the specific circumstances.

**Q6: Do you handle B-BBEE compliance related to CIPC?**
A: We ensure your CIPC records support B-BBEE verification. For the full B-BBEE scorecard and certification, we may refer you to a specialist agency.

**Q7: How often must annual returns be filed?**
A: Annual returns must be filed once per year, based on the anniversary of your company's registration date. The filing window and fees are set by CIPC.

- **Description:** Companies Act compliance and secretarial services for SA companies. Board resolutions, MOI amendments, statutory registers, and governance support. (149 chars)

### Service Intro (150 words)
The Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, imposes a range of ongoing obligations on South African companies — from maintaining statutory records and passing required resolutions to ensuring the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) accurately reflects how the company operates. These requirements apply regardless of company size, but many SMEs lack the in-house resource to manage them consistently. We provide company secretarial services that ensure your company remains fully compliant with the Companies Act. This includes maintaining registers of directors, shareholders, and beneficial interests, preparing board and shareholder resolutions, ensuring proper meeting procedures, and managing MOI amendments. Our goal is to take the administrative burden of statutory compliance off your plate, so you can focus on running your business with the confidence that your corporate records are in order.

### Deliverables
- Statutory register maintenance (directors, shareholders, beneficial interests)
- Board and shareholder resolutions
- MOI drafting and amendments
- Share register and certificate management
- Annual compliance calendar
- Written resolutions for specific corporate actions
- Governance documentation and advisory

### Process Steps
1. **Compliance audit** — We review your existing corporate records and identify gaps or overdue items.
2. **Remediation** — We prepare any outstanding resolutions, registers, or filings.
3. **Ongoing management** — We maintain your registers and prepare required resolutions as events occur.
4. **Annual review** — We conduct an annual review of your statutory records and compliance calendar.

### FAQs

**Q1: What statutory records must a company keep?**
A: Under the Companies Act, companies must maintain registers of directors, shareholders, beneficial interest holders, and company secretary details. They must also keep copies of board and shareholder resolutions.

**Q2: Do I need a company secretary?**
A: Public companies and state-owned companies are required to appoint a company secretary. Private companies (Pty Ltd) are not required to, but many benefit from having one for governance and compliance purposes.

**Q3: What is an MOI and why does it matter?**
A: The Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) is the founding document that governs how your company operates. It sets out shareholder rights, director powers, and key processes. If your MOI is outdated or generic, it can create problems during disputes, shareholder changes, or audits.

**Q4: How do I pass a board resolution?**
A: Board resolutions can be passed at a meeting or by written consent (round-robin). We draft the resolution and manage the process to ensure it is properly recorded.

**Q5: Is this service relevant for small companies?**
A: Yes. The Companies Act applies to all registered companies, regardless of size. Non-compliance can result in penalties and legal exposure.

**Q6: Can you help during a dispute between shareholders?**
A: We can ensure corporate records and resolutions are in order, which is often critical during disputes. For legal representation, we would refer you to a specialist attorney.

Errors in payroll can result in SARS penalties, employee disputes, and labour compliance issues. Our payroll service handles the entire cycle — from calculating gross-to-net pay and generating payslips to submitting EMP201 returns to SARS and reconciling EMP501 at year-end.

### Service Intro (145 words)
An audit is only as smooth as the preparation behind it. Many businesses enter the audit process with incomplete records, missing documentation, or unresolved discrepancies — which leads to delays, qualified opinions, and additional costs. Our audit readiness service helps you prepare before the auditors arrive. We review your financial records, identify gaps, resolve discrepancies, and assemble the documentation your auditors will request. This includes bank confirmations, creditor and debtor reconciliations, fixed asset registers, and supporting schedules. Whether you are facing a statutory audit, a donor-funded audit, or a voluntary audit to support a tender or investor requirement, we ensure your records meet the standard expected. We do not perform the audit itself — we prepare your business so the audit runs efficiently and without surprises.

### Deliverables

- Bank and inter-company reconciliations

2. **Gap remediation** — We resolve discrepancies, prepare missing schedules, and complete reconciliations.
3. **File assembly** — We compile a structured audit file with all required documentation.
4. **Readiness confirmation** — We confirm that records are ready and brief you on what to expect.
5. **Audit support** — If needed, we liaise with auditors during the engagement to respond to queries.

### FAQs

**Q1: Do you perform the actual audit?**
A: No. We prepare your records and documentation so the audit process runs smoothly. The audit itself must be conducted by a registered auditor.

**Q2: When should I start preparing for an audit?**
A: Ideally, preparation should begin at least eight to twelve weeks before the audit date. The earlier we start, the more thoroughly we can resolve any issues.

**Q3: What does a gap analysis include?**
A: We review your trial balance, reconciliations, supporting documentation, and statutory filings to identify anything that is incomplete, inconsistent, or missing.

**Q4: Can you help if our records are in poor shape?**
A: Yes. Part of our service involves reconstructing and reconciling records where needed. The scope and timeline will depend on the extent of the issues.

**Q5: Is audit readiness only for statutory audits?**
A: No. We also prepare businesses for donor audits, voluntary audits, and due diligence processes required for tenders, investors, or acquisitions.

**Q6: Will this reduce our audit fees?**
A: In most cases, yes. A well-prepared audit file means auditors spend less time on queries and follow-ups, which typically reduces the time and cost of the engagement.
