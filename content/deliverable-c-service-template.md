# DELIVERABLE C — Service Page Template

This template applies to all 11 service pages. Every service page must follow this exact section order.

---

## Page Purpose
Each service page exists to clearly explain one service, who it is for, what the client receives, and how to get started. The page must be self-contained — a visitor arriving from search should understand the full value without needing to visit the homepage first.

---

## Mandatory Section Order

### 1. Service Hero
- **H1**: Clear service name + benefit-oriented phrasing
- **Summary**: 2–3 sentences explaining what the service is and who it helps (80–120 words)
- **Primary CTA**: Request a Quote
- **Secondary CTA**: Book a Consultation

### 2. Who This Is For
- **Format**: 4–6 bullet points
- **Content**: Describe the specific types of businesses, professionals, or situations this service addresses
- **Tone**: Direct and specific — the visitor should immediately recognise their own situation

### 3. What's Included (Deliverables)
- **Format**: 5–8 bullet points
- **Content**: Tangible outputs the client receives (reports, filings, documents, etc.)
- **Rule**: Every bullet must describe something the client can see, read, or use — not vague promises

### 4. Process (Step-by-Step)
- **Format**: 4–6 numbered steps
- **Content**: What happens from initial contact through to ongoing delivery
- **Rule**: Must set clear expectations without making time or outcome guarantees

### 5. What We Need From You
- **Format**: Simple checklist (4–6 items)
- **Content**: Documents, access, or information the client needs to provide
- **Tone**: Helpful and straightforward — reduce anxiety about onboarding

### 6. Timeline Expectations
- **Format**: 1 short paragraph (40–60 words)
- **Content**: General indication of how long setup and delivery typically take
- **Rule**: Use language like "typically", "in most cases", "depending on complexity" — never promise fixed turnaround

### 7. FAQs (Mandatory)
- **Format**: 6–10 Q&A pairs
- **Content**: Real, helpful questions that a prospect or client would actually ask
- **Rule**: Must include at least 1 ZA-specific question (SARS, CIPC, etc.) where relevant
- **Schema**: FAQPage structured data should be applied (implemented in SEO phase)

### 8. CTA to Quote / Onboarding
- **Format**: Full-width CTA block
- **Content**: Short reassurance line + primary CTA button
- **Primary CTA**: Request a Quote
- **Reassurance**: "No obligation. We respond within one business day."
- **Internal links**: Link to Contact/Quote page

## Internal Linking Requirements Per Service Page
- Link to 2 related services (specified in Deliverable E)
- Link to the parent pillar page
- Link to the Quote/Onboarding page
- Use descriptive anchor text (never "click here")
