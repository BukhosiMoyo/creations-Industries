# PROMPT 5 — Homepage Structure, Content & SEO

No code. No UI. No animations. No patterns.

## SECTION ORDER RECONCILIATION

PROMPT 5 refines PROMPT 0's 11-section order into 10 purpose-driven sections. Mapping:

| PROMPT 5 Section | Maps to PROMPT 0 Section(s) |
|---|---|
| 1. Hero | 1. Hero |
| 2. Trust & Credentials Strip | NEW — extracted from Hero trust row, expanded |
| 3. What We Do (Services Summary) | 2. Pillars Overview + 3. Services Preview Grid (combined) |
| 4. How It Works | 4. How It Works |
| 5. Why This Firm (Differentiators) | 5. "What You Get" + 6. About Preview (evolved) |
| 6. Use Cases / Who We Help | 7. Use Cases / Industries |
| 7. Proof & Testimonials | 8. Testimonials |
| 8. Insights / Content Preview | 9. Resources / Blog Preview |
| 9. FAQ | NEW — homepage-level FAQ for conversion |
| 10. Final CTA + Footer | 10. Final CTA + 11. Footer |

All PROMPT 0 required content is preserved. No section is removed — some are merged or repositioned for stronger conversion flow.

## GLOBAL SEO STRATEGY

### Target Keyword Themes (Homepage)

| Priority | Theme | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Accounting services South Africa | Commercial — find a firm |
| Primary | Tax compliance services SA | Commercial — find tax help |
| Primary | CIPC compliance services | Commercial — CIPC assistance |
| Secondary | Bookkeeping for small business SA | Commercial — specific service |
| Secondary | Business advisory South Africa | Commercial — strategic help |
| Secondary | Payroll services South Africa | Commercial — employer needs |
| Long-tail | Accounting firm for SMEs South Africa | Commercial — segment match |
| Long-tail | SARS tax return help | Informational → commercial |
| Long-tail | Tender readiness support SA | Commercial — niche need |

### On-Page SEO Rules
- **One H1.** Contains primary commercial keyword theme naturally.
- **H2 hierarchy.** Each section has one H2 that signals topical relevance.
- **Internal links.** Minimum 15 internal links from homepage: 3 pillar pages, 9+ service pages, quote page, about page, sitemap.
- **Anchor text.** Descriptive, keyword-relevant. No "click here."
- **Location signal.** "South Africa" or "South African" appears naturally 3–5 times across the page. Not stuffed.
- **Schema.** Organization, LocalBusiness, and FAQPage structured data applied.

---

## SECTION 1 — HERO (ABOVE THE FOLD)

### Purpose
Immediate clarity on what this firm does and who it serves. First 3 seconds must answer: "Is this relevant to me?"

### Content Structure
- **H1:** Single headline combining what the firm does + who it serves
- **Supporting paragraph:** 2–3 sentences expanding on the value proposition (40–60 words)
- **Primary CTA:** "Request a Quote" — high-intent action
- **Secondary CTA:** "View Our Services" — exploration path
- **Trust indicators:** 3–4 compact badges (details in Section 2 below)

### Headline Direction
The H1 should combine the service category + audience + location signal. Examples of direction (not final copy):
- Direction A: [Service scope] + [for whom] + [geography]
- Direction B: [Outcome] + [for business type] + [how]
- Direction C: [What we handle] + [so you can] + [outcome]

The H1 must NOT be:
- A question
- A single abstract word
- Pure branding without service clarity
- Longer than 15 words

### Supporting Paragraph Direction
Must answer: "What specifically do you do, and why should I care?" in under 60 words. Should mention 2–3 of: accounting, tax, compliance, payroll, advisory. Should reference South African businesses.

### SEO Intent
- Define the firm's primary topical territory for search engines
- Establish Entity relevance (accounting firm + South Africa + SME audience)
- H1 carries the highest on-page SEO weight — must include primary keyword theme naturally

### Conversion Logic
- Above the fold: H1 + subheadline give enough clarity to act
- Primary CTA captures high-intent visitors immediately
- Secondary CTA routes explorers into the services funnel
- Trust badges below CTAs reduce hesitation before scrolling

---

## SECTION 2 — TRUST & CREDENTIALS STRIP

### Purpose
Immediately reduce the "can I trust this firm?" hesitation that every accounting prospect has. This section bridges the hero and the services — it earns the right to be listened to.

### Content Structure
- Horizontal strip or compact grid of 4–6 credential items
- Each item: icon + short label (3–6 words max)
- No long descriptions — this is a visual credibility bar

### Credential Items (Recommended)

| # | Credential | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | SARS eFiling Registered | Confirms ability to file directly with SARS |
| 2 | CIPC Compliance Specialists | Signals expertise in company compliance |
| 3 | Serving Businesses Across South Africa | Geography and scale signal |
| 4 | POPIA Compliant | Data protection — important for document handling |
| 5 | Cloud-Based & Secure | Signals modern infrastructure |
| 6 | Trusted by Start-ups & SMEs | Audience alignment |

### Headline Direction
This section may or may not have an H2. If it does:
- Direction: "Registered. Compliant. Ready." (short, punchy, credential-focused)
- Or: no heading — the strip speaks for itself

### SEO Intent
- **E-E-A-T reinforcement.** Google's quality guidelines prioritise Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. This section directly addresses Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness.
- **LocalBusiness signal.** "South Africa" mention, "SARS", "CIPC" — all reinforce local commercial relevance.
- Schema support: credentials feed into Organization structured data.

### Conversion Logic
- Addresses the #1 objection on accounting firm websites: "Are they legitimate?"
- Compact format: scans in under 2 seconds
- Positioned immediately after hero so trust is established before the visitor reads service details

---

## SECTION 3 — WHAT WE DO (SERVICES SUMMARY)

### Purpose
Show the full scope of services quickly. Help visitors self-sort into the right service area. This is the primary internal linking engine of the homepage.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Scope-communicating heading
- **Pillar introductions:** 3 pillar groups (Compliance, Accounting, Intelligence) — each with a one-line description
- **Service cards:** 9–11 cards (one per service), each with: service name + one-line description + "View Details" link
- **Bottom CTA:** "View All Services" linking to the Services Hub

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Accounting, Compliance, and Intelligence Services" (literal, SEO-friendly)
- Direction B: "What We Do" (simple, clear)
- Direction C: "Services Built for Every Stage of Business" (audience-aware)

The H2 should be SEO-useful without being stuffed. Prefer clear service language over creative phrasing.

### SEO Intent
- **Internal linking hub.** This section generates 9–11 internal links to individual service pages + 3 links to pillar pages. This is the most link-dense section on the page.
- **Topical clustering.** Grouping services under pillars signals to search engines that this site has depth across accounting, compliance, and advisory topics.
- **Keyword coverage.** Each service card title contains a service keyword (bookkeeping, tax services, payroll, CIPC compliance, etc.)

### Conversion Logic
- Visitors who know what they need can jump directly to a service page
- Visitors who are unsure can browse the pillar groups to orient
- "View All Services" catches anyone who wants more detail before choosing

---

## SECTION 4 — HOW IT WORKS

### Purpose
Remove the fear of complexity. Show that engaging with this firm is straightforward, structured, and low-friction.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Process-oriented heading
- **3–4 steps** (reduced from 5 in PROMPT 1 for homepage brevity — full 5-step version lives on the How It Works page)
- Each step: number + title + 1–2 sentences
- **Bottom CTA:** "Book a Consultation"

### Step Direction (3-Step Homepage Version)

| Step | Title Direction | Content Direction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Tell Us What You Need" | Brief consultation or form submission. We listen, assess scope. |
| 2 | "We Send a Clear Proposal" | Transparent scope, deliverables, and fees. No surprises. |
| 3 | "We Get to Work" | Onboarding, access setup, and ongoing service delivery begins. |

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Getting Started Is Simple"
- Direction B: "How It Works"
- Direction C: "From Enquiry to Ongoing Support — In 3 Steps"

### SEO Intent
- **Informational relevance.** Addresses "how does an accounting firm work" type queries.
- **Conversion reassurance.** Reduces the perceived effort of engaging, which directly supports form submission rates.
- Internal link to the full How It Works page for visitors who want the detailed version.

### Conversion Logic
- Answers the question "What happens when I reach out?" before the visitor asks it
- 3 steps (not 5) keeps it scannable on the homepage
- CTA at the bottom captures visitors who feel the process is manageable

---

## SECTION 5 — WHY THIS FIRM (DIFFERENTIATORS)

### Purpose
Answer the critical question: "Why should I choose this firm over any other accounting firm?" This section must differentiate without hype.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Differentiator-focused heading
- **4 differentiator blocks**, each with: icon + title + 2–3 sentence explanation
- **No CTA in this section** — it builds conviction, the CTA follows in later sections

### Differentiator Direction

| # | Differentiator Title Direction | Explanation Direction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Precision & Compliance Focus" | Every filing, return, and report is accurate. We prioritise getting it right, not getting it fast. SARS and CIPC compliance is our core discipline. |
| 2 | "Data-Driven, Not Guesswork" | We use your actual financial data to inform advice. Custom dashboards, structured reports, and analytics give you clarity — not opinions. |
| 3 | "Built for South African Business" | We work within the South African regulatory landscape daily: SARS, CIPC, Companies Act, PAYE, UIF, SDL. We understand the local context. |
| 4 | "Modern Systems, Traditional Discipline" | Cloud-based tools, digital workflows, and structured processes — combined with the rigour and reliability of experienced accounting professionals. |

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Why Businesses Choose Us"
- Direction B: "What Sets Us Apart"
- Direction C: "Precision. Data. Local Expertise."

### SEO Intent
- **Brand differentiation signals.** Helps search engines understand the firm's unique positioning within the competitive landscape.
- **E-E-A-T: Experience and Expertise.** Differentiators communicate real capability, not marketing fluff.
- Mention of SA-specific frameworks (SARS, CIPC, Companies Act) strengthens local relevance.

### Conversion Logic
- By this point the visitor knows: what the firm does (section 3), how the process works (section 4), and now WHY this firm specifically
- This section eliminates the "they all say the same thing" problem by tying each differentiator to a concrete capability

---

## SECTION 6 — USE CASES / WHO WE HELP

### Purpose
Help visitors self-identify. When a prospect sees their own situation described, trust and relevance increase immediately.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Audience-identifying heading
- **4–5 use case blocks**, each with: business type title + 2–3 sentence scenario + link to relevant service(s)
- **Bottom CTA:** "Find Your Service" or "Request a Quote"

### Use Case Direction

| # | Business Type | Scenario Direction | Links To |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Start-ups & New Registrations | Just registered with CIPC. Need tax registration, bookkeeping setup, first SARS returns. | CIPC Compliance, Tax Services, Bookkeeping |
| 2 | Growing SMEs | Scaling fast, admin falling behind. Need proper financials, payroll, and advisory. | Accounting, Payroll, Advisory |
| 3 | Tender-Driven Businesses | Bidding on contracts. Need tax clearance, CSD, B-BBEE, and financial statements. | Tender Readiness, Tax Services |
| 4 | Sole Proprietors & Professionals | Need provisional tax handled, annual financials, and straightforward advice. | Tax Services, Bookkeeping, Advisory |
| 5 | Compliance-Heavy Companies | Multiple entities, complex CIPC and Companies Act obligations. | CIPC Compliance, Companies Act, Audit Readiness |

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Built for Businesses Like Yours"
- Direction B: "Who We Help"
- Direction C: "Find Your Situation"

### SEO Intent
- **Long-tail keyword capture.** Each use case aligns with long-tail queries: "accounting for start-ups SA", "tender readiness support", "payroll for growing business South Africa."
- **Internal linking.** Each use case links to 2–3 service pages, creating a dense internal link web.
- **Industry/segment signals.** Helps search engines understand the firm serves multiple business segments.

### Conversion Logic
- Self-identification is one of the strongest conversion triggers — "they understand my situation"
- Each use case has a direct path to a relevant service page, shortening the journey to quote

---

## SECTION 7 — PROOF & TESTIMONIALS

### Purpose
Social proof from recognisable business types. Validates the promises made in earlier sections.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Social proof heading
- **4–6 testimonial cards** (sample until real ones replace them)
- Each card: quote + name + role/business type
- **No CTA in this section** — proof flows naturally into the next section

### Testimonial Direction
Testimonials should:
- Reference specific services (bookkeeping, SARS filing, tender prep — not generic "great service")
- Mention outcomes the reader can relate to (on-time filings, clean books, tender compliance)
- Come from business types that match the use cases in section 6

Sample structure:
- Testimonial 1: Start-up founder — SARS filing experience
- Testimonial 2: SME owner — monthly reporting clarity
- Testimonial 3: Construction director — tender compliance
- Testimonial 4: Sole proprietor — catching up outstanding returns
- Testimonial 5: Retail owner — payroll reliability
- Testimonial 6: Tech founder — advisory and dashboards

All samples must be clearly marked as "Sample testimonial" until replaced with verified real client feedback.

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "What Our Clients Say"
- Direction B: "Trusted by South African Businesses"
- Direction C: "Real Feedback. Real Businesses."

### SEO Intent
- **Trust signals.** Testimonials contribute to E-E-A-T (Experience). Google recognises social proof as a quality signal.
- **Keyword variation.** Testimonials naturally introduce related keyword phrases without stuffing.
- Schema: Review structured data may be applied if testimonials are verified.

### Conversion Logic
- By section 7, the visitor has seen services, process, differentiators, and use cases. Testimonials validate everything above.
- Outcome-focused wording matters: "They filed our returns on time" is stronger than "Good firm."

---

## SECTION 8 — INSIGHTS / CONTENT PREVIEW

### Purpose
Signal expertise and establish content authority. Prepare for future SEO growth through educational content.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Content/expertise heading
- **3 article preview cards**, each with: title + one-line summary + category tag
- **"Coming Soon" label** if blog is not yet active — acceptable for launch
- **Future CTA:** "Subscribe for Updates" (placeholder for now)

### Article Direction

| # | Title Direction | Category |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Understanding Provisional Tax in South Africa | Tax |
| 2 | CIPC Annual Returns: Deadlines and Penalties | Compliance |
| 3 | Payroll Compliance Basics: PAYE, UIF, SDL, COIDA | Payroll |

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Insights & Resources"
- Direction B: "Stay Informed"
- Direction C: "From Our Knowledge Base"

### SEO Intent
- **Content authority signal.** Even with "Coming Soon" labels, showing article titles tells search engines the site intends to provide educational content on these topics.
- **Future internal linking.** Once articles are published, they become landing pages for informational queries that feed into commercial service pages.
- **Topical breadth.** Preview titles span Tax, Compliance, and Payroll — reinforcing the firm's topical range.

### Conversion Logic
- Not a direct conversion section. Its role is to reinforce expertise and signal that this firm is a knowledge resource, not just a service provider.
- "Coming Soon" is acceptable at launch — it signals intent without faking content.

---

## SECTION 9 — FAQ (MANDATORY)

### Purpose
Address the most common objections and questions that prevent a prospect from submitting a quote request. This is an objection-handling section, not an information dump.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** FAQ heading
- **6–8 Q&A pairs** in collapsible accordion format
- Questions must address: pricing, process, compliance, onboarding, and trust
- **FAQPage structured data** applied for search visibility

### FAQ Direction

| # | Question Direction | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "How much do your services cost?" | #1 question every prospect has. Answer: scope-based pricing, free quote, no hidden fees. |
| 2 | "Do you handle SARS filings and compliance?" | Validates core capability for compliance-driven visitors. |
| 3 | "What if my books are behind or in poor condition?" | Removes the shame/fear barrier — many prospects delay because of this. |
| 4 | "How quickly can you start?" | Addresses urgency for deadline-driven prospects. |
| 5 | "Do I need to change my accounting software?" | Removes a practical objection — they fear disruption. |
| 6 | "What industries do you work with?" | Confirms breadth for visitors unsure if they qualify. |
| 7 | "Are you registered with SARS and CIPC?" | Direct trust question — simple yes answer. |
| 8 | "What happens after I submit a quote request?" | Process transparency — reduces post-submission anxiety. |

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Frequently Asked Questions"
- Direction B: "Common Questions"
- Direction C: "Questions Before You Start"

### SEO Intent
- **Featured snippet eligibility.** Well-structured Q&A pairs with FAQPage schema are eligible for Google's FAQ rich results, which appear directly in search results.
- **Long-tail keyword capture.** Each question targets a specific search query (e.g., "how much does an accountant cost in South Africa").
- **Conversion support.** FAQs answered on-page mean fewer visitors leave to search for answers elsewhere.

### Conversion Logic
- FAQs directly address the objections that prevent form submission
- Positioned just before the final CTA so objections are handled immediately before the conversion prompt
- Accordion format keeps the section compact — visitors scan questions and open only what matters to them

---

## SECTION 10 — FINAL CTA + FOOTER

### 10A: Final CTA Block

### Purpose
Final conversion prompt. Captures visitors who have consumed the full page.

### Content Structure
- **H2:** Action-oriented closing heading
- **1–2 sentences** of calm, confident copy (no pressure)
- **Reassurance line:** "No obligation. No hidden fees. We respond within one business day."
- **Primary CTA:** "Request a Free Quote"

### Headline Direction
- Direction A: "Ready to Get Your Business in Order?"
- Direction B: "Let Us Handle the Numbers"
- Direction C: "Start With a Conversation"

### SEO Intent
- Minimal SEO role — this section is pure conversion.
- Internal link to `/quote` page.

### Conversion Logic
- The visitor has read everything. They know services, process, differentiators, use cases, testimonials, and FAQ answers. If they have not already clicked a CTA, this is the final prompt.
- "No obligation" removes the last barrier: fear of commitment.
- Tone: calm and confident, not aggressive. "Let us handle the numbers" — not "Don't miss out!"

---

### 10B: Footer

### Content Structure
- **4 link groups:**
  - Services (all 11 service links)
  - Company (About, How It Works, Use Cases, Contact)
  - Resources (Blog/Insights, FAQ, HTML Sitemap)
  - Legal (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
- **Bottom bar:** Copyright, "Request a Quote" link, sitemap link
- **Sitemap note:** "View our full site map" — links to `/sitemap`

### SEO Intent
- **Crawl coverage.** Footer links ensure all key pages are accessible from every page on the site.
- **Internal link equity.** Site-wide footer links distribute page authority across the site.
- **HTML sitemap link.** Supports both users and search engines in discovering all pages.

## CONFIRMATION: THIS HOMEPAGE FIXES PREVIOUS ISSUES

### 1. "Empty Homepage" Issue — FIXED
Every section has a defined purpose, content structure, and headline direction. No section is decorative-only. No section relies on visuals to carry weight — each has real, useful content.

| Section | Content Type | Empty Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | H1, paragraph, CTAs, trust badges | None — fully specified |
| Trust Strip | 4–6 credential items | None — concrete items listed |
| Services Summary | 9–11 cards + pillar groupings | None — all services defined |
| How It Works | 3 steps with descriptions | None — steps specified |
| Differentiators | 4 blocks with explanations | None — real capabilities |
| Use Cases | 4–5 scenarios with links | None — business types defined |
| Testimonials | 4–6 quotes (samples accepted) | Low — clearly marked as samples |
| Insights | 3 previews (Coming Soon OK) | Low — titles and intent defined |
| FAQ | 6–8 Q&A pairs | None — questions and answer direction specified |
| Final CTA | Headline, copy, reassurance, button | None — fully specified |

### 2. Trust Gap — FIXED
Trust is addressed in multiple layers:
- **Section 1 (Hero):** Trust badges visible above the fold
- **Section 2 (Trust Strip):** Expanded credentials (SARS, CIPC, POPIA, local presence)
- **Section 5 (Differentiators):** Why this firm specifically
- **Section 7 (Testimonials):** Social proof from relatable business types
- **Section 9 (FAQ):** Direct answers to trust-related questions ("Are you registered?")

Trust is not concentrated in one section — it is distributed across the page, reinforced at every scroll depth.

### 3. SEO Weakness — FIXED
- **H1** contains primary keyword theme naturally
- **H2 hierarchy** covers: services, process, differentiators, use cases, testimonials, insights, FAQ
- **15+ internal links** to service pages, pillar pages, quote page, about, and sitemap
- **FAQPage schema** for rich results eligibility
- **Organization + LocalBusiness schema** for entity clarity
- **South African context** woven naturally (SARS, CIPC, PAYE, UIF — not stuffed)
- **Long-tail coverage** through use cases and FAQ questions
- **Content authority** signalled through insights section (even as "Coming Soon")
