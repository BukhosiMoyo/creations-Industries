### Service Intro (150 words)
Good bookkeeping is the foundation of every well-run business. Without accurate, up-to-date records, tax filings become stressful, financial decisions become guesswork, and compliance deadlines become a risk. Our bookkeeping service gives South African businesses — from sole proprietors to growing SMEs — a reliable, structured process for keeping their financial records in order. We handle bank reconciliations, expense categorisation, creditor and debtor management, and monthly reporting. Whether you use Xero, Sage, QuickBooks, or another platform, we work within your existing setup or help you choose one that fits. You receive clear monthly reports so you always know your cash position, outstanding invoices, and upcoming obligations. No backlog, no guesswork, no missed entries.

### Deliverables

- Creditor and debtor management
- Expense categorisation and processing
- Monthly management accounts
- Trial balance and general ledger maintenance
- VAT-ready transaction records
- Xero / Sage / QuickBooks data management

### Process Steps
1. **Initial review** — We assess your current bookkeeping status and identify any backlogs or gaps.
2. **System setup** — We configure or integrate your accounting software for clean, ongoing processing.
3. **Monthly processing** — Transactions are recorded, categorised, and reconciled each month.
4. **Reporting** — You receive monthly management accounts with a summary of key figures.
5. **Ongoing support** — We answer questions, adjust categories, and keep your books audit-ready.

### FAQs

**Q1: What accounting software do you support?**
A: We work with Xero, Sage, QuickBooks, and most major cloud accounting platforms. If you do not currently have software, we can recommend and set up the right one for your business.

**Q2: I have a backlog of several months. Can you catch it up?**
A: Yes. We regularly take on clients with outstanding bookkeeping. We will assess the backlog and provide a timeline and quote to bring everything up to date.

**Q3: How often will I receive reports?**
A: We provide monthly management accounts as standard. If you need weekly or fortnightly reporting, we can accommodate that based on the scope of your engagement.

**Q4: Do I need to provide physical documents?**
A: No. We work digitally. You can share bank statements, invoices, and receipts via email, cloud storage, or directly through your accounting software.

**Q5: Is bookkeeping the same as accounting?**
A: Not quite. Bookkeeping is the recording and organising of financial transactions. Accounting includes interpreting that data, preparing financial statements, and advising on tax and compliance. We offer both.

**Q6: Can this help with my VAT submissions?**
A: Yes. Accurate bookkeeping ensures your VAT records are correct and ready for submission. We work closely with our tax services team to keep everything aligned.

**Q7: What if I am a sole proprietor — do I still need bookkeeping?**
A: Yes, especially if you are registered for income tax or VAT. Proper records make annual tax filing easier, support deductions, and reduce the risk of SARS queries.

Clear, accurate financial statements are essential for every South African business — whether you are reporting to shareholders, applying for finance, or preparing for a tax filing. Our accounting service covers the full cycle: from monthly management accounts to annual financial statements prepared in line with the applicable reporting framework. We work with start-ups, SMEs, and established companies across industries, providing financial reporting that is structured, compliant, and useful. Our team prepares income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and notes — ensuring everything is reconciled and supported. If you need financials for your bank, investors, or SARS, we prepare them to the standard expected. We also offer ongoing management accounting so you can track performance throughout the year, not just at year-end.

### Deliverables

- Monthly or quarterly management accounts
- Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements

- Year-end adjustments and journals
- Supporting schedules and notes

### Process Steps
1. **Engagement setup** — We define the scope, reporting framework, and delivery schedule.
2. **Data collection** — We gather trial balances, bank statements, and supporting documentation.
3. **Processing and review** — Journals, reconciliations, and adjustments are prepared and checked.
4. **Financial statement preparation** — Full statements are compiled with notes and disclosures.
5. **Delivery and discussion** — We walk you through the numbers and answer your questions.
6. **Ongoing reporting** — Monthly or quarterly management accounts are delivered on schedule.

### FAQs

**Q1: What reporting framework do you use?**
A: We prepare financial statements under IFRS for SMEs or the appropriate framework applicable to your entity. We will advise on the correct framework during onboarding.

**Q2: Can you prepare financials for a bank loan application?**
A: Yes. We prepare financial statements and supporting packs that meet the requirements of South African banks and lending institutions.

**Q3: What is the difference between management accounts and annual financial statements?**
A: Management accounts are internal reports used for ongoing decision-making. Annual financial statements are formal, compliant reports typically required for tax filings, audits, or stakeholder reporting.

**Q4: How long does year-end preparation take?**
A: It depends on the complexity and state of the records. Typically, if bookkeeping is up to date, year-end statements can be prepared within two to four weeks.

**Q5: Do you handle the full accounting cycle or just the year-end?**
A: Both. We can manage monthly bookkeeping and accounting through to year-end, or step in specifically for annual financial statement preparation.

**Q6: What if my records are in poor condition?**
A: We can reconstruct and reconcile records as needed. We will assess the extent of the work and provide a separate quote if a catch-up engagement is required.

Tax compliance in South Africa involves multiple submission types, strict deadlines, and detailed record-keeping. Whether you are a sole proprietor filing income tax returns, a company managing provisional tax and VAT, or a business that needs to resolve an issue with SARS, our tax services are built to keep you compliant and informed. We handle annual income tax returns (ITR12, ITR14), provisional tax submissions (IRP6), VAT returns (VAT201), and Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) reconciliations. We also assist with SARS registrations, tax clearance certificate applications, and responding to SARS queries or verification requests.

We do not guarantee specific outcomes, but we do ensure your submissions are complete, accurate, and defensible.

**Q2: Can you help with a SARS audit or query?**
A: Yes. We assist with SARS verification requests, audits, and objections. We prepare the necessary supporting documentation and manage communication with SARS on your behalf.

**Q3: What if I have unfiled returns from previous years?**
A: We can help. We will assess what is outstanding, prepare the necessary returns, and submit them. Penalties may apply from SARS, but resolving the situation is always better than leaving it unaddressed.

**Q4: Do you handle VAT registration?**
A: Yes. We assist with voluntary and compulsory VAT registration, including preparing and submitting the application to SARS.

**Q5: How do I know if I need to register for provisional tax?**
A: If you earn income that is not subject to PAYE — such as freelance income, rental income, or business profits — you are likely required to register as a provisional taxpayer. We can assess your situation.

**Q6: Can you help me get a tax clearance certificate?**
A: Yes. We handle tax clearance applications through SARS eFiling. A valid tax clearance requires that all returns are up to date and there are no outstanding SARS debts.

**Q7: What is the deadline for income tax submissions?**
A: Deadlines vary by taxpayer type and filing method. We track all applicable deadlines for our clients and ensure submissions are made on time.

### Meta

- **Description:** Business advisory for South African SMEs. Strategic financial planning, cash flow analysis, and growth support grounded in real data. (133 chars)

### Service Intro (155 words)
Good advice starts with accurate numbers. Our advisory services give South African business owners and decision-makers access to structured financial guidance — whether you are planning for growth, preparing for investment, managing cash flow pressure, or evaluating a major business decision. We work from your actual financial data, not assumptions. That means the advice you receive is specific to your business, not generic templates. Our advisory support ranges from ad-hoc financial analysis to ongoing CFO-level support, depending on what your business needs. We help you interpret your financial position, model scenarios, and make decisions with confidence. Whether you are a start-up building your first budget or an SME preparing a presentation for investors, we bring the structure and clarity that turns numbers into direction.

### Deliverables
- Cash flow analysis and forecasting
- Budgets and financial projections

3. **Recommendations** — We present clear, data-backed options with pros, cons, and projected outcomes.
4. **Implementation support** — We help you apply the recommendations and track progress.
5. **Ongoing review** — Regular check-ins ensure the strategy stays relevant as your business evolves.

### FAQs

**Q1: Is this the same as having a CFO?**
A: It can be. Our advisory services range from project-based analysis to ongoing CFO-level support. You get the strategic insight without the full-time cost.

**Q2: I am a small start-up. Is advisory relevant for me?**
A: Yes. In fact, early-stage financial planning — budgeting, cash flow forecasting, and pricing strategy — can prevent problems that are expensive to fix later.

**Q3: Do I need up-to-date financials before I can use this service?**
A: Ideally, yes. Advisory is most effective when based on current data. If your books are behind, we can help catch them up first through our bookkeeping or accounting services.

**Q4: What kind of decisions can advisory help with?**
A: Common scenarios include: evaluating whether to hire, planning for a new location, deciding between financing options, restructuring costs, and preparing for a sale or investment round.

**Q5: How often would we meet?**
A: That depends on the scope. Some clients meet monthly, others quarterly. Ad-hoc advisory for a specific project may involve a concentrated series of sessions.

**Q6: Can you prepare financial projections for a bank or investor?**
A: Yes. We prepare professional, data-backed financial projections and supporting packs formatted for bank loan applications or investor presentations.
