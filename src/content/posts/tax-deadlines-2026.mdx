Running a business in South Africa means keeping a close eye on your calendar. Missing a SARS deadline can result in immediate 10% penalties and interest. 

This guide breaks down every critical date you need to know for the 2026 tax year (1 March 2025 – 28 February 2026).

## The Big Ones: Provisional Tax

Provisional tax is not a separate tax; it's a way of paying your income tax in advance to ensure you don't owe a massive lump sum at year-end.

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
If your taxable income exceeds R1 million, your second provisional payment must be within 80% of your actual liability to avoid underestimation penalties.

### 1. First Provisional (IRP6)
*   **Deadline:** 29 August 2025
*   **What to pay:** Half of your estimated total tax for the year.
*   **Tip:** Don't just use last year's figures if your business has grown. SARS expects a realistic estimate.

### 2. Second Provisional (IRP6)
*   **Deadline:** 27 February 2026
*   **What to pay:** The balance of your estimated total tax for the year.
*   **Tip:** This is the most dangerous deadline. Underestimating here triggers the Section 89quat interest.

### 3. Third Provisional (Top-up)
*   **Deadline:** 29 September 2026
*   **Who needs this:** Only if you significantly underestimated your February payment.

## Monthly Obligations: PAYE & VAT

While income tax is semi-annual, your operational taxes are strictly monthly or bi-monthly.

### EMP201 (PAYE, UIF, SDL)
*   **Deadline:** 7th of every month.
*   **Rule:** If the 7th falls on a weekend, you must pay by the Friday *before*.

### VAT201
*   **Deadline:** 25th (Manual) or last business day (eFiling) of your cycle month.
*   **Tip:** Most SMEs are on Category A (Odd months) or Category B (Even months). Check your registration form (VAT103) to be sure.

## Employer Filing Season (EMP501)

Twice a year, you must reconcile the PAYE you declared (EMP201s) with the IRP5 certificates you will issue to staff.

1.  **Interim Reconciliation:** Opens September 2025, Closes October 2025.
2.  **Final Reconciliation:** Opens April 2026, Closes May 2026.

<Callout type="success" title="Pro Tip">
Do your interim reconciliation! It makes the final filing season much less stressful because you fix 6 months of errors instead of 12.
